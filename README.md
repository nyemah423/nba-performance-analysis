# NBA Top Performer Prediction

This project explores what attributes contribute to top NBA performance using a combination of data cleaning, feature engineering, and predictive modeling in Python.

## About the Project
Using a dataset of NBA players since 1996, I created a classification model to predict whether a player will become a top performer based on attributes like height, weight, college attended, and rookie age.

I also conducted visual analysis in Tableau to explore player trends and support my model's findings.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Tableau (linked in portfolio)

## Key Highlights
- Cleaned and processed real-world basketball data
- Engineered features from multiple datasets (career stats + rookie data + top performance)
- Built and evaluated predictive models (Random Forest)
- Balanced the dataset and tuned thresholds for improved accuracy
- Interpreted results for use by NBA scouts and analysts
